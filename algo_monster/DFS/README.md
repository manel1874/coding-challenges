## In-order Traversal
In-order traversal visits the left branch first, then the current node, and finally the right branch.

## Pre-order Traversal
Pre-order traversal visits the current node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. 

## Post-order Traversal
Post-order traversal visits the left subtree first, then the right subtree, and finally the current node.

Note: Backtracking always happen in depth-first search. 

DFS is essentially pre-order tree traversal, because we visit the current node first.
